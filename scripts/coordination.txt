INs and OUTs

Structure from Stereo View (master node)
-Handles library calls via x motion limits
-Handles ROS topic communication

Libraries:

Find Keypoints
-Input: stereo camera image paths of same base name
-Output: keypoints each image and match list + other stuff

Calculate Projection Matrix
-Input: base image path, camera calibration matrix
-Calls: Find Key Points (for keypoints each image and match list)
-Output: projection matrix option

Triangulate
-Input: ordered list of matching keypoints pairs, projection matrixes, *camera calibration matrix  
-Output: point cloud in camera frame

Transform Pointcloud
-Input: odom pose and point cloud in camera frame
-Output: pointcloud in odom frame

ICP
-Input: takes odom cummlative point cloud (scene) and new point cloud (view)
-Output: updated scene point cloud and transform matrix to view to scene
